/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with user-ownership for user profiles.
 * Guests, attendance, waste, and infrastructure data are publicly readable, but require authentication and specific roles for write access.
 *
 * @data-structure
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owning user and authorized roles.
 * - /guests/{guestId}: Guestbook entries, publicly readable, write access limited to specific roles.
 * - /attendance/{attendanceId}: Attendance records, publicly readable, write access limited to specific roles.
 * - /waste/{wasteId}: Waste records, publicly readable, write access limited to specific roles.
 * - /sarpras/{sarprasId}: Infrastructure data, publicly readable, write access limited to specific roles.
 *
 * @key-security-decisions
 * - User listing is explicitly denied for privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted for guest, attendance, waste and infrastructure data.
 * - Role-based access control is used for write operations on guest, attendance, waste and infrastructure data.
